Then from a command line I ran:
regedit.exe /s w10_stop_reset-fileasso.reg  which is the edit script from the web site recommended by others. for fixing this problem.

No change.  I've rebooted, and no change.  Still get six notifications after reboot.  Still get endless hundreds of notifications if I rename a .txt fileon my desktop to .html.  All of the notifications are about HTML.  No other file associations seem to be affected.

Walt,

The fix worked 100% for all others who applied it and you can check that in Answers forums or in the post comments. regedit.exe /s would have suppressed any errors if it encountered any. Can you re-run without "/s" param. I think the registry settings weren't applied correctly.

Addendum:

For example if there is a typo in the file name (that means passing a non-existent file as the parameter), regedit.exe "/s" wouldn't notify you.
